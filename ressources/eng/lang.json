        "CONTENT": "At CESI the lectures are replaced by <i>problem-based learning</i>. Knowledge is acquired entirely through practice and problems close to the real world. This allows students to acquire experience, autonomy and practical skills.",
        "QUOTE": "Problem-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogy in which students learn about a subject through the experience of solving an open-ended problem found in trigger material. The PBL process does not focus on problem solving with a defined solution, but it allows for the development of other desirable skills and attributes. This includes knowledge acquisition, enhanced group collaboration and communication.",
